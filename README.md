# Youtube-Recommendation-Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the Youtube datasets by building a query engine and exploring factors contributing to the recommendation algorithms. It is important because we can know how the querying information from databases works and understand the recommendation algorithms.

I used the Datasets of Normal Crawl (Xu Cheng & Cameron Dale & Jiangchuan Liu) which was retrieved from https://netsg.cs.sfu.ca/youtubedata/. To store and query data, I used MongoDB because it is easy to use. Then I compare information of related videos through histograms and tables and display them through a website.
